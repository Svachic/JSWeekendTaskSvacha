 Simple flights search app using Kiwi.com API

This is a very simple flights search application write in React using kiwi.com API to fetch the data. Type only from, where to and when you want to flight and search. 

This is my very first experience with the React and also with GraphQL. I know that exist some good libraries(Apollo or Relay) for GraphQL, but I use only basic fetch method to fetch the data from the GraphQL API. There is also some basic suggestion of locations and basic pagination of flights result.
